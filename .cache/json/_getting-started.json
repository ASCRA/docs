Kojis can be shared via a link on social media and messengers\nas well as in an embedded iframe on a website.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a developer, you can build web applications on Koji, called\n“templates,” that enable users to customize, or “remix,” them without\ncoding. At their core, Koji templates are embeddable, mini-web\napplications written in modern JavaScript. They are designed to be\nresponsive, so that they can run on any browser and every device. They\nalso enable non-technical users to quickly edit elements, such as\nimages, text, and sounds, to create a custom version that they can share\nanywhere on the web.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On Koji, you can develop templates that will be used and shared by\nmillions of users across the world. You can also monetize your work\nthrough licensing, asset packs, and other developer compensation\nprograms. With the ability to create and share remixable, interactive\ncontent, the opportunities for creative new applications and experiences\nare countless. We can’t wait to see what YOU make!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/Koji-developer.svg\" alt=\"Overview of the Koji development process\" title=\"Koji development process\"></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_getting_started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For some great resources to help you start developing templates on Koji,\nsee:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"../gettingStarted/startGuide1.adoc\">Starter guide</a> –\nStep-by-step instructions on how to create a remixable web application\nand publish it as a template on Koji.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://withkoji.com/developer/getting-started-course\">Starter course</a> – Video\ntutorial of how to start developing applications on Koji.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_staying_in_touch\">Staying in Touch</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6\">Koji community</a> on Discord to\nconnect with other developers, makers, and the Koji team.
