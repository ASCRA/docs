Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) enable users to quickly edit elements of your application on Koji.
The Koji platform includes VCCs for the following standard types of elements:

* xref here – page description here (can we do this automatically?)

VCC types can be composed using higher-order controls. Note that arrays and objects can be combined to create more elaborate compositions.

* <<array.adoc#>>

The Koji platform also supports custom VCCs to provide new types of customizations that match closely with the application you are developing.

* Browse custom VCCs – Use a custom VCC.
* For more information, see the tutorial.
* link to docs (need to decide if we want "related resources" or something like that, or if this is a note)
