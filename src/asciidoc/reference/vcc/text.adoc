= Text, TextArea
:page-slug: /reference/vcc/text

* Text can be changed by clicking the input field and typing the new text.
* A TextArea VCC can be used by defining a `type` of `textarea`.
* The difference between the 'Text Area' and just 'Text' is that a text area allows line breaks within it. Text can be changed by clicking in the input field and typing the new text.
