:page-slug: cat-selector-blueprint

Follow this blueprint to build a template for a custom Koji VCC to give remixes the option to select from a drop down of choices which are retrieved from a third party API.

=== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with web development.
React and ES6 basics are a plus.
* Understanding of third-party API use is a plus.
* Familiarity with the Koji remix process.
For an overview, see the <<start-guide-1#, starter guide>>.
* Familiarity with Koji custom VCCs is a bonus.
For an overview, see <<build-custom-vcc#>>.

=== Level

* *Koji*: Intermediate – Advanced
* *Developer*: Intermediate – Advanced
* *Time*: 30 minutes

== Building blocks

=== Remix the scaffold

Remix an existing web application on Koji that implements basic elements of your favorite framework.

.React
https://withkoji.com/templates/seane/simple-react-scaffold-remix-[Simple React scaffold]

.Vanilla JS
https://withkoji.com/templates/JamesHole/vanilla-js-scaffold-with-vccs[Vanilla JS scaffold]

=== Install the packages

Install @withkoji/custom-vcc-sdk to enable custom VCC functionality, such as loading and saving the VCC value from Koji.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save @withkoji/custom-vcc-sdk
----

=== Create the customization files
Create `.koji/customization/settings.json` to define customizable values for the API URL, and the items key and item name key from the API response.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/vcc-blueprint-settings.json[tags=!configuration]
----
<1> Customizations will be added here in the next step

Remove the unused customization files.

`colors.json`, `images.json`, and `strings.json`

=== Configure the API
For this blueprint we implement https://thecatapi.com/[The Cat API] which can return a list of cat breeds but you can use any API that returns a list of items.

Set the values for the API in the settings customisation file so your app can access the API.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/vcc-blueprint-settings.json[tags=configuration]
----

=== Add the template logic
Import the packages

[source,javascript]
----
import CustomVCC from '@withkoji/custom-vcc-sdk';
----

Initialize the CustomVCC and set a listener to load the Koji theme, this allows you to style your VCC to match the current user’s theme on Koji (dark/light).

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=constructor,indent=0]
----

.Vanilla JS
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCVanilla.js[tags=initTheme,indent=0]
----

Register your custom VCC to connect to Koji and set a listener to update your application state when the custom VCC updates.

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=mount,indent=0]
----
.Vanilla JS
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCVanilla.js[tags=registerVCC,indent=0]
----

Make a call to the API endpoint retrieving the values needed.

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=loadAPI,indent=0]
----

.Vanilla JS
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCVanilla.js[tags=loadAPI,indent=0]
----

Create a setter to return the selected value from your application back to the VCC on Koji

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=selectValue,indent=0]
----
.Vanilla JS
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCVanilla.js[tags=selectValue,indent=0]
----

Using the values from the loaded Koji theme and the API results render a drop down to allow users to make the selection of the VCC value

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=render,indent=0]
----

.Vanilla JS
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCVanilla.js[tags=render,indent=0]
----

=== Add the styles
Add the styles to the application loading values from the theme to make it look like a native Koji input.

.React
[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/customVCCReact.js[tags=styles,indent=0]
----

.Vanilla JS
[source,css]
----
include::../_includes/vcc-blueprint-styles.css[]
----

=== Test

To save development time, Koji provides an easy way to test a custom VCC before it is published. First you will need to create a test consumer project, do so by remixing https://withkoji.com/templates/seane/simple-react-scaffold-remix-[Simple React Scaffold].

. In your custom VCC project, click the Remote tab in the right pane.
. Click Copy URL to get the staging URL for your project.
. Open your consumer project.
. In your consumer project, open the Strings customization file, and click Code to view the raw JSON.
. For the title field, change the type to match this format, using the URL you just copied as YOUR-URL: +
`"type": "custom<YOUR-URL>"`
. Save the file, and return to the Visual view of the customization file. You should see your custom VCC.

=== Publish
Custom VCCs require a custom domain to be accessible to other Koji Apps. Go to  *Advanced > Custom domains*, and add a domain under the koji-vccs.com root domain.

Click Publish now and enter a Name, Description and other publish settings, as desired. Then, click Publish.

After you publish your custom VCC, you can use it in a Koji template with the VCC type: +
`"type": "custom<YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME>"`
