== What are blueprints?

Blueprints are a quick way to build something cool on Koji. Each blueprint includes a simple, block-by-block guide and an “as-built” code sample for a fun Koji application.

These blueprints are intended for developers who prefer to jump straight to code. For a step-by-step intro to Koji, head to the link:/developer/getting-started[starter guide].
